# Module-4-Challenge

Webpage using html, css, and javascript.

Created a form to get user inputs that are pushed to local storage

2nd page shows the blog posts that are pulled from local storage. Also includes a back button to the form page and a dark mode light mode toggle button.

2nd page also includes a footer with a link to portfolio and instagram (just something else to have on the footer). 

Code on the first page is mostly original, got ideas from the previous activities in class.
  the location.replace and blogPost.push was obtained from an outside source.
